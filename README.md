# Arduino_Basic_Use
It is mainly used for open source sharing of some basic Arduino projects, which can be used to realized some specific functions. I hope everyone can point out some problems,exchange and learn together.
Here are some functions of the power module controlled by Arduino's sensors.
'Servobysensor'————simulates the water environment and controls the steering gear, forming a switch function.
'Scbmq'————is a method to write the measured value of ultrasonic module. Here, simulation can judge whether the object that can be closed has been closed.
